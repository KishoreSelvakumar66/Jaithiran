<h2 id="p1"> Radiotherapy Treatment</h2>
<p>Radiotherapy uses high energy X-rays (or similar rays) to treat cancer.

  It damages your body's cells in the treatment area, killing cancer cells but allowing your normal cells to recover.
  
  s vary depending ois being treated. Our radiotherapy team can give you more information.
  
  Treatment takes place over a number of days or weeks. This is so you only get small doses (fractions) of radiation. Your doctor will decide the amount of radiation and how many treatments you need....</p>

    <h2 id="p2">  Gynaecology Treatment</h2>
    <P>Although heavy bleeding, painful cramps, crazy mood swings, bloating, etc. can be a common issue during your “red flag days,” it doesn’t mean that this is always normal. Your body tells you that there is something very wrong when these symptoms persist for a long time. It can be rightly said that almost every woman around the globe suffers from a gynaecological problem at a certain point in her life. In most cases, these problems are mild and easily treatable, while some of them are serious and can affect their fertility and quality of life.</P>

   <h2 id="p3">Neurosurgery Treatment</h2>
   <p>In most cases, your primary healthcare provider or your neurologist will refer you to see a neurosurgeon if you have a neurological condition that requires or would benefit from an in-depth assessment.

    Neurosurgeons have extensive knowledge about your brain, central nervous system, peripheral nervous system and spine, and the conditions that can affect them.
    
    Just because your healthcare provider recommends you see a neurosurgeon, that doesn’t necessarily mean surgery is around the corner.
    
    Instead, it means you’ll receive a comprehensive neurological exam, a review </p>

<h2 id="p4">  Endocrinology Treatment</h2>
<p> Many hormonal disorders can be treated or managed with medication or hormone replacement therapy. Some conditions require more advanced treatment or surgery. Your endocrinologist in the Sutter Health network will talk with you about treatment options and guide and coordinate any advanced procedures you may need.Some hormone disorders, such as an underactive thyroid, can be treated with daily hormone medication.</p></div>

<h2 id="p6">Anesthesiologists Treatment</h2>
<p>Anesthesiology, anaesthesiology, or anaesthesia is the medical specialty concerned with the total perioperative care of patients before, during and after surgery.[1] It encompasses anesthesia, intensive care medicine, critical emergency medicine, and pain medicine.[2] A physician specialized in anesthesiology is called an anesthesiologist, anaesthesiologist, or anaesthetist, depending on the country.[3][4][5][6] In some countries, the terms are synonymous, while in other countries, they refer to different positions and anesthetist is only used for non-physicians, such as nurse anesthetists.</p>

<div class="ig7">
    <img src="image/Cardio.jpg" alt="">
<h2 id="p7">Cardiology Treatment</h2>
<p>Interventional cardiology is a non-surgical option which uses a small, flexible tube called a catheter to repair damaged or weakened vessels, narrowed arteries, or other affected parts of the heart structure. An interventional cardiologist is a cardiologist with one to two years of additional education and training in diagnosing and treating cardiovascular disease as well as congenital (present at birth)</div><div class="ig8">
    <img src="image/general-surgery.jpg" alt="">
<h2 id="p8">General surgery Treatment</h2>
<p>General surgery, as the name denotes, encompasses a broad spectrum of operative procedures with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of injuries and diseases in any region of the body. Its scope of interest includes the skin, breasts, abdomen, peripheral vasculature, and head and neck, among other areas.

    The abdominal viscera, which includes the small and large bowels, liver, gall bladder and bile ducts, pancreas, appendix, spleen and the stomach, may be the focus of this specialty</p>
